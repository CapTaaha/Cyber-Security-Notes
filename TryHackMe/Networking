NETWORKING

1.OSI Model: (please do not throw my salami pizza away)
Application     , Presentation, Service, Transport  , Network, Data Link, Physical
(User Interface)  (translate    (Session)(TCP/UDP)    (IPV4/6)   (MAC)      (Hardware)      
(Data)             for comp to  (Data)   (Segments/   (Packets) (Frames&   (Bits)
                   understand)            Datagrams)             trailer)
                   (Data)


*TCP-Transmission Control Protocol(3 way handshake)(connection-based protocol)

*UDP-User Datagram Protocol(packets of data are essentially thrown at the receiving computer -- if it can't keep up then that's its problem)

*MAC-Media Access Control(MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can't be changed -- although they can be spoofed)


*Application->...->Physical == Encapsulation
*Physical->...->Application == De-Encapsulation


2.TCP/IP Model:
Application=>(Application, Presentation, Service),
Transport=>(Transport),
Internet=>(Network),
Network Interface=>(DataLink, Physical)

*OSI model was also introduced by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO); however, it's mainly used as a more comprehensive guide for learning, 
as the TCP/IP model is still the standard upon which modern networking is based.



3.ping:
*Checking if connection to remote resource is possible
*ping <target>



4.traceroute:
*Traceroute can be used to map the path your request takes as it heads to the target machine.
*traceroute <target> (Linux)
*For Windows => "tracert"



5.WHOIS:
*Whois essentially allows you to query who a domain name is registered to.
*whois <domain>
